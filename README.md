[Pastio](http://cixtor.com/pastio) is a web service that provides similar functionality to that of the popular **Pastebin** website.

It offers a code editor with syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages and the ability to store the code in the server for an unlimited period of time. Additionally, a list of recent content can be accessed from the interface as long as the user is authorized.

The interface also allows to do pair programming by leveraging the collaboration functionality to the [Mozilla Together.JS](https://togetherjs.com/) project which offers audio, chat, user focus (multi-cursors) and real-time content synchronization.

This is the third iteration of the project, originally written in Node.js with the node-webkit UI tookit, then re-implemented in PHP with the Laravel framework as a website, and ultimately re-written as a web service powered by the Go programming language.
