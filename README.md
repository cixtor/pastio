### Pastio

[Pastio](http://cixtor.com/pastio) is a web service that provides similar functionality to the popular _Pastebin_ website. It offers a basic code editor with syntax highlighting in multiple programming languages, and the ability to store the code in the server for an unlimited period of time. Additionally, a list of recent pastes can be accessed from the interface as long as the user is authorized to do so. The interface also allows collaboration leveraging the functionality to the [Mozilla Together.JS](https://togetherjs.com/) project which offers audio chat, user focus (multi-cursors), text chat, and real-time content synchronization.

This is the 3rd iteration of the project, originally built on top of Node.JS then rewritten in PHP using the Laravel framework, and ultimately rewritten as a web service powered by the Go programming language.
